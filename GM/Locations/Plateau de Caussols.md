**Location of the Covenant**

A high limestone plateau in the backcountry of the Alpes-Maritimes, roughly northwest of Grasse. It sits at about **1,100 m elevation**, a shallow bowl several kilometres across. In summer the sun bleaches it bone-white; in winter it ices over and the mistral scours everything down to stone.

It’s classic **karst** country: riddled with dolines (sinkholes), dry streambeds, fissures, and caves. Surface water simply vanishes into the rock and re-emerges miles away as cold springs. The plateau is ringed by low ridges—Courmettes and Calern—and accessible only through narrow cols that can be easily watched or warded.

The soil is thin, barely enough for scrub oak, juniper, thyme, and lavender. Shepherds still use it for transhumance: flocks in summer, abandonment in winter. That seasonal rhythm gives you your cultivated-versus-barren contrast: olive and perfume farms in the valleys below; skeletal grazing land and caves above.

The plateau feels _open yet claustrophobic_—you can see for miles, but there’s nowhere to hide except underground. Night comes fast, and the wind screams through fissures like an organ. Visibility from the coast is good; ships far below can glimpse torchlight on clear nights, which could feed local tales of “the monastery of lights.”

That contrast—perfumed valleys of Grasse below, sterile white stone above—makes it ideal for your covenant’s alchemical duality. The scent trade in the valleys gives you literal _vis of fragrance_: distilled resins, angelica roots, ambergris off the coast. The plateau gives you the barren geometry needed for summoning circles and burial caves.
